## About

This repository contains the analytic code for the study **“Women’s Empowerment and Child Nutritional Outcomes in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Multi-Country DHS Analysis.”** The study uses harmonised Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data to examine domain-specific associations between women’s empowerment, measured using the SWPER Global Index, and child nutritional outcomes (stunting, underweight, wasting, and overweight).

All statistical analyses were conducted in **Stata**, including survey-weighted country-specific regression models accounting for the complex DHS sampling design and the generation of pooled effect estimates for meta-analysis. **R** was used exclusively for data visualisation, including forest plots, scatterplots, and multi-panel figures.

The code is shared to support transparency and reproducibility in global health research. DHS data are publicly available upon request from the DHS Program, subject to their data use agreement.
